    "__In other words, subtracting $\\psi$ from every $\\theta^{(j)}$ does not affect our hypothesis’ predictions at all!__ This shows that softmax regression’s parameters are \"redundant\". More formally, we say that our softmax model is \"overparameterised\" meaning that for any hypothesis we might fit to the data, there are multiple parameter settings that give rise to exactly the same hypothesis function $h_\\theta$ mapping from inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, if the cost function $J(\\theta)$ is minimized by some setting of the parameters $(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(2)},\\dots,\\theta^{(k)})$, then it is also minimised by $\\theta^{(1)}-\\psi,\\theta^{(2)}-\\psi,\\dots,\\theta^{(k)}-\\psi)$ for any value of $\\psi$. Thus, the minimiser of $J(\\theta)$ is not unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Interestingly, $J(\\theta)$ is still convex, and thus gradient descent will not run into local optima problems. The Hessian is however singular/non-invertible, which causes a straightforward implementation of Newton's method (a second-order optimiser) to run into numerical problems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also that by setting $\\psi=\\theta^{(K)}$, one can always replace $\\theta^{(K)}$ with $\\theta^{(K)}-\\psi=\\mathbf{0}$ (the vector of all $0$’s), without affecting the hypothesis. Thus, one could \"eliminate\" the vector of parameters $\\theta^{(K)}$ (or any other $\\theta^{(k)}$, for any single value of $k$), without harming the representational power of our hypothesis. Indeed, rather than optimising over the $K \\cdot n$ parameters $(\\theta^{(1)},\\theta^{(2)},\\dots,\\theta^{(k)})$  (where $\\theta^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, one can instead set $\\theta^{(K)}=\\mathbf{0}$  and optimize only with respect to the $(K-1) \\cdot n$ remaining parameters."
